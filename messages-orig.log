Jess:
Hey, did you get the design mockups for the new
drinks page?

Ray:
Yeah, just pulled them in—those animated glitch
effects on the drink cards are chef’s kiss.

Jess:
Nice. I'm working on the homepage banner animation.
You on the NeuroNet server yet?

Ray:
Not yet. Can you resend the SSH login? I nuked
my keys by accident!

Jess:
No problem. It’s still the usual temp creds
Username: <color=#E82629>dev</color=#E82629>
Password: <color=#E82629>quickTempPass</color=#E82629>

Ray:
Got it, logging in now. You ever think we
should just switch to key-based auth
for everything?

Jess:
Yes, every day. But NeonDripz HQ still wants
human-readable passwords for staging.

Ray:
Sigh. Okay, I'm in. Also—did you notice
the site loads slow on mobile?

Jess:
Yup. I traced it to the hero video—it's not
lazy-loaded yet. I’ll patch that in.

Ray:
Cool. I also cleaned up a few unused assets
in /public/images/—that alone shaved like 400KB.

Jess:
Bless. You always find that junk like a
code raccoon.

Ray:
It's a talent. Oh, and I added a neon-mode
toggle. Glows based on time of day!

Jess:
Bro. That’s dope. Let's push the build
after we QA on staging?
It's on <color=#E82629>{DeviceIP:HF_CofSD_Beginner_neuronetmedia}</color=#E82629>

Ray:
Yep. Gimme 10 mins to finish testing
the new menu carousel.
